This is a game that my group coded for one of my modules in university. This is just a fun project that I may update with my friend in the future.


                  ```   HOW TO PLAY THE SUTD LIFE SIMULATOR    ```                   

```MAIN OBJECTIVE```
Complete all your tasks and survive the SUTDent life.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASKS
For the entire duration of the game, there is a list of tasks that you have to
do in order to graduate successfully as a SUTDent. If you do not complete these
tasks, you will be EXPELLED!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIME
There is a limited amount of time(hours) that you have in each day of the game.
and a set of actions that you can choose to do with that time. It's up to you 
to decide on how you want to use your free time. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO GAIN POINTS
[1] Study: 1 Hour = 1 Knowledge
[2] Hang Out with Friends: 1 Hour = 1 Social 
[3] Exercise: 1 Hour = 1 Physical Health 
[4] Go for Fifth Row: 1 Hour = 0.5 Knowledge + 0.5 Social
[5] Nap: 1 Hour = 1 Mental
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANDOM EVENTS
At the start of each day, there can be a random event that will be thrown at you.
It can affect your statistics either positively or negatively, and there is nothing
you can do about it. Welcome to the uncertainties of life!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO QUIT
If you want to drop out of SUTD (or in other words, stop playing), feel free to
to end the kernel.
